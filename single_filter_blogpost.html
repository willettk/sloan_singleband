<i>How does a galaxy's morphology change with wavelength?</i>

<br><br>
In Galaxy Zoo 1 and 2 we showed you images of galaxies taken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). These images
combine information from 3 (g, r, i) of the 5 observational filters used by Sloan (u, g, r, i, z) to produce a single colour image for
each galaxy. Each of the 5 filters observe the galaxy at different wavelengths, with the u-band more sensitive to hot
young stars at shorter wavelengths, through to the z-band being more sensitive to cooler, older populations of stars at
longer wavelengths. The 5 Sloan filters and their wavelengths are shown in Figure 1.

<br><br>
With each of the 5 filters gathering light from different populations of stars, we are interested in seeing
how a galaxy's morphological classification may differ across each of the filters individually. For example, do spiral arms containing young stars become more prominent in bluer bands? And do bulges in spiral galaxies, which tend to be formed of older stars, look bigger in redder bands? To investigate these, and many other morphological properties, we take a sample
of 1000 SDSS imaged galaxies and split their combined colour image back down into the original 5 single filter images
(see Figure 2). These monochromatic images are then put into Galaxy Zoo, and with your continued help classifying, we
hope to answer our original question soon!
